# WarGGus mod
Allows you to play Warcraft II with the [StrataGGus](https://github.com/ipochto/strataGGus) project.
A copy of the original Warcraft II game is required to access its assets.

- Improved UI with modern controls and features;
- Enhanced balance and significantly increased gameplay variety through redesigned and additional units, as well as new game mechanics (such as map highgrounds, line-of-sight blocking, airdrops etc.);
- Generation of new graphics (for new units and expanded tilesets) based on original game assets to preserve the visual style.
